# Drone-Controller-by-Hand-Gestures
This repository hosts a Python-based solution for controlling a drone using hand gestures. Leveraging computer vision technologies, particularly the powerful CVZone and OpenCV (cv2) libraries, this project enables intuitive and hands-free drone piloting.
Features:
•	Gesture Recognition: The system is capable of recognizing various hand gestures, allowing users to control the drone's movement seamlessly.
•	Real-time Processing: Utilizing the speed and efficiency of OpenCV, the system processes hand gestures in real-time, ensuring responsive and accurate control.
•	Customizable: Developers can easily extend and customize the gesture recognition system to suit specific needs and preferences.
•	Easy Integration: Designed with simplicity in mind, integrating this controller into existing drone projects is straightforward.
Dependencies:
•	CVZone: A comprehensive computer vision library that simplifies complex tasks like hand gesture recognition.
•	OpenCV (cv2): A widely-used open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
Usage:
1.	Install the required dependencies using pip.
2.	Clone this repository to your local machine.
3.	Customize the gesture recognition and drone control logic to fit your requirements.
4.	Run the main Python script to start controlling your drone with hand gestures!
